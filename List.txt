List of items I had to do to make everything work.

- Made a .env using .env.example with my connections and configurations

- made entrypoint.sh file and added and ran through compose.yml for database
  migrations to initialize the database schema changed the Dockerfile and set
  this as ENTRYPOINT 

- added the pytest dependency in requirement.txt as it was missing

- Made an account on ethereal to send and receive emails and added the 
  credential in .env.example and .env file

- Used GitHub secrets to add the credentials in the GitHub environment

- I made the nightlyBuild.yml file that either triggers at a specified time or 
  on a manual run from GitHub actions and sends a failure or success email on 
  the respective event that occurred. 

- I made a Conventional Commits workflow have commit message standards for the 
  main branch and pull requests to the main branch. This commit_conventional.yml
  file will verify commit messages using webiny/action-conventional-commits@v1.3.0, 
  label invalid PRs, and it will send an email on failure, and automatically closes
  PRs with incorrect commit messages.

- dealt with errors of pytest dependency missing

- GitHub works on UTC so adjusted the the time to Pacific Standard Time zone 

- The Docker Credentials access token was read-only and initially gave an error to
  push images to Docker Hub, dealt with it by changing it to read write, and delete

- The push to main will allow the push even if the test fails later after the push as
  GitHub Actions runs after the push is made so the build will fail but the push will be succesfull.
  not same for the PR to main it will not merge untill the build passes.

- Had issues with the write permission for workflow, changed it to read and write also added
  permission explicitly to conventional_commit.yml file as well to close PR if invalid commit message.
